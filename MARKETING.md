**Title:** I built a "Should I Go Outside?" dashboard for Singapore - Exercise safety score, laundry forecast, activity suggestions

**Body:**
Hey r/singapore!

Got tired of checking multiple apps just to figure out if I can go jogging or hang my laundry. So I built this:

**[sg-outdoor-guide.onrender.com](https://sg-outdoor-guide.onrender.com)**

What it does:
- 🏃 **Exercise Safety Score (0-100)** - Combines PSI + UV + temperature + humidity to tell you GO / CAUTION / AVOID
- 👕 **Laundry Forecast** - YES / NO / SLOW (we all ask this lah)
- 🎯 **Activity Suggestions** - Changes based on conditions (raining → museum, clear evening → ECP cycling)
- 🌬️ **PSI by Region** - All 5 zones
- 🌧️ **Rain Alert** - Banner when showers expected

All data from data.gov.sg APIs - 100% real government data, updated in real-time.

It's free, no login, no ads. Just answers the questions we actually ask.

Let me know if you have suggestions for other features!

**Tweet 1:**
🇸🇬 Built a "Should I Go Outside?" app for Singapore

Not another weather app. This one actually answers:
- Can I exercise? (PSI + UV + temp + humidity = score)
- Will my laundry dry?
- What should I do today?

Free, real-time gov data 👇

**Tweet 2:**
The Exercise Score combines:
• PSI levels
• UV index  
• Temperature
• Humidity

Into one number (0-100) with a clear verdict:
🟢 GO! 
🟡 CAUTION
🔴 AVOID

No more checking 4 different sources

**Tweet 3:**
Yes, there's a Laundry Forecast 👕

Because every Singaporean asks "can dry anot?"

It checks:
• Rain probability
• Humidity levels

Then tells you YES / NO / SLOW

Simple.

## Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title:** Show HN: SG Outdoor Guide – Exercise safety score and laundry forecast for Singapore

**Body:**
I built a dashboard that answers the questions Singaporeans actually ask about going outside.

Demo: https://sg-outdoor-guide.onrender.com
GitHub: https://github.com/jonathanwxh-cell/sg-outdoor-guide

Features:
- Exercise Safety Score (0-100): Combines PSI + UV + temp + humidity into GO/CAUTION/AVOID
- Laundry Forecast: YES/NO/SLOW based on rain + humidity
- Activity suggestions that change based on conditions
- Real-time PSI by region

Tech: Python Flask, vanilla JS, data.gov.sg APIs (free, no key needed), hosted on Render free tier.

The idea came from constantly checking multiple apps to figure out if it was okay to jog. Singapore's tropical weather + occasional haze makes this genuinely useful.

Would love feedback on other features that would be useful!
